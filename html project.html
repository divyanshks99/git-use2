<h1 style="background-color:red";>What Is Coding?</h1>
<p>
Sometimes Code is Easy to understand

Coding is the process of using a programming language to get a computer to behave how you want it to. Every line of code tells the computer to do something, and a document full of lines of code is called a script.
</p>

<p>Each script is designed to carry out a job. This job might be to take an image and change its size. 
It might play a certain sound or piece of music. When you click like on someone’s post on social media, a script is what makes it happen.
</p>

<p>Unlike people, computers will do exactly what you tell them to. This might sound great, but it can cause problems. 
If you tell a computer to start counting upwards, and don’t tell it to stop, 
it’ll keep counting forever! Being a good programmer is all about knowing how to tell a computer to act.</p>
